        Origin Story of Nodebucket Project Management Company
        In the bustling city of Silverwood, two childhood friends, Alice Bennett and Mark Donovan, shared a dream of revolutionizing project management. Inspired by their favorite childhood game, "Bucket Brigade," where they worked together to achieve a common goal, they founded Nodebucket in 2015.

        Nodebucket's name was derived from their favorite childhood treehouse, where they made important decisions and stored their ideas in a literal bucket hung from a node in the tree. This symbolized their belief in collaboration, organization, and growth.

        With their passion for technology and teamwork, Alice and Mark combined their expertise in software development and business management to create Nodebucket. The company quickly gained recognition for its innovative approach to project management, focusing on agility, transparency, and client satisfaction.

Their journey from childhood friends with a dream to a thriving project management company is a testament to the power of passion and teamwork.
